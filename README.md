## 📖 Our Story

Code Experts was born out of frustration—our founders were successful businesspeople, not IT professionals, but they constantly struggled with software vendors who didn’t understand their workflow. Determined to find a better way, they dove deep into how software really works: which platforms are flexible, how to manage data migration securely, and what makes a system easy to maintain. That led them to open-source ERP software, which promised a customizable, transparent solution.

Unfortunately, initial implementations still fell short: many IT firms couldn’t speak the “business language” and their teams lacked real programming insight. So the founders took matters into their own hands, became certified in the leading open-source ERP, and launched Code Experts. Today, every member of our organization knows both sides—business processes and technical execution—so you can be confident your custom ERP is in expert hands.
